# Java-midi-player
A simple midi player in java

The following is a simple implementation of the java midi player (The idea of which has been taken from MIT open courseware - Course 6.005 Elements of Software Construction)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionalities :-
1. The notes of the octave above middle C are played on the numeric keys, starting with 1 on the left and ending with the = key on the right, with a semitone between each (so that each pair of adjacent keys corresponds to a pair of adjacent keys on a real piano, including the black ones). Also the notes can be played using mouse click

2. Different instruments can be chosen (Using the keyboard as well as the mouse. The instruments are used is cycles)

3. There is provision for playing back a midi test file. (We can play any midi file by changing the name of the file in the code)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations :-
1. Due to time constraints I was not able to implement the recording capability.
2. The U/I was done using the swing builer of Netbeans (for faster workflow)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Learning :-
1. Swing interface desihgn
2. Midi package of java
3. Playing sound using midi in java
4. Event handling in java
